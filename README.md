# libAddr
Postal address tools and utilities

## Purpose
This library is designed to break apart a United States postal
address street line into its component parts.  During this
process it will convert certain keywords into their normalized
US Post Office proper equivalents - such as "ROAD" to "RD".

## CAUTIONS
This library is not endorsed, supported, or in any way, shape,
or form recognized by the United State Post Office.  Entities
looking for officially recognized software should contact any
of the various commercial vendors offering such.
